# Mobi Services – Mobile Repair Shop Website

Hi, I’m **Aravindh** 👋  
I am doing an internship with **Future Interns** as a **Prompt Engineer**.

During this internship, I developed a complete website for a **mobile service shop** **using prompts alone**. I didn’t write the code manually — I created the whole project step-by-step just through prompt engineering. It was an amazing experience and helped me understand how powerful prompts can be.

### 💡 What this project includes
- Homepage  
- Services page  
- Contact section  
- Call-to-action buttons  
- Responsive design for mobile and laptop  
- Content created fully using AI prompts

### 😅 A funny part of the journey
I got **stuck at the final stage** because my website was showing a **404 error on GitHub Pages**.  
Even that issue was finally **fixed using a prompt** 🤣

### 🚀 What I learned
- How to design websites using AI
- How to write effective prompts
- Hosting websites using GitHub Pages
- Debugging using prompt engineering

### 🛠️ Technologies used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GitHub Pages
